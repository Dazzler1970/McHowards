                <h2>McHoward's Back-Office is a Family Run Business</h2>
                <p>Newly, Established in 2019, by Tanya McMillan-Howard and her Husband Daron.</p>

                <p>They realised that most small businesses haven't access to a range of staff or facilities for
                    Bookkeeping, Payroll Management, Human Resource, and in most case even simple Document Processing.
                </p>

                <p>After many conversations, it was realised that Tanya's experience in each of these areas,
                    could be beneficial for all small businesses</p>

                <p>Tanya was born and grew up in Adelaide South Australia, after finishing school she gained experience
                    in the catering sector and worked
                    in the retail construction sector for 13 years.</p>

                <p>In 1997 she moved with her family to Northern Ireland. She completed her HNC in Business
                    Administration in 2003 and has since worked
                    in back-office administration in the following sectors. Administration in
                    the Community Care Sector, Administration in the Construction Sector,
                    Marketing in the Corporate Signage Sector, Community Care Co-ordination, Finance Assistant, Payroll
                    Manager, Accounts Supervisor and HR Advisor.</p>


                <p>Following the crash in 2008, the business retracted and Tanya found that she was doing more than
                    the one original job. Her experiences have been gained in an economy which required staff to
                    multi-task,
                    significantly cutting back on staff, with many differing experiences,
                    saving the company many thousands in wages. Tanya completed and achieved a Level 5 BTEC in Payroll
                    Management in 2012.
                    In 2017 she completed her CIPD Level 3 in HR Practice. </p>

            <div>
                <p> Daron, was born in South Eastern, Kent in England and after completing school, went to work in the
                    retail sector.
                    His skills related to customer service, which comes from over 30 years talking to people,
                    looking to understand their concerns.
                    In this time, he's worked in various positions from sales floor to lower management,
                    striving to put the customer first.</p>
                <p>In 2016 Daron felt it was time to make a change in his life, feeling that retail wasn't where his
                    dreams lay, he decided to retrain, he chose to start a course
                    Studying Computing and Network Development. He completed his HNC in 2018, with full
                    distinctions. This taught him that complete commitment is essential for all endeavours
                </p>
